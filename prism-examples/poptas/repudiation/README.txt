This case study concerns the non-repudiation protocol of Markowitch & Roggeman [MR99].

The models here are partially observable probabilistic timed automata (POPTAs),
as described in [NPZ17]. These extend the the probabilistic timed automaton (PTA)
version from [NPS13], the files for which can be found in ../../ptas/repudiation.
Both are extensions of the PTA model developed in [LMST04].
