This case study concerns the problem of scheduling tasks between several processors.

The models here are partially observable probabilistic timed automata (POPTAs),
as described in [NPZ17]. These extend the the probabilistic timed automaton (PTA)
version from [NPS13]. Both are extensions of the timed automaton example from [BFLM11].
